# Phonebook app 

Developed as an assignment for Section 3 of my [Full Stack Open repository](https://github.com/Niosni/FullStackOpen2023).

## Working app
The working application is deployed using Fly.io and is [available here](https://puhelinluettelo-app-niemela.fly.dev/).

## Stack

The front-end code for this project is available [here](https://github.com/Niosni/FullStackOpen2023/tree/master/osa2/puhelinluettelo), and is built to directory `dist` here for easy deployment from single directory. The backend communicates with a document database hosted with MongoDB.
